// Session-compaction plugin — Foundation-phase stub.
//
// Placeholder per .kiro/specs/session-compaction. Loads cleanly into
// opencode's plugin runtime so subsequent Nix wiring (task 1.3) and
// rebuild verification (task 1.4) can land before behavior is
// introduced. The full handler chain (token tracking, threshold logic,
// cavemem augmentation, manual compaction, observability) is filled
// in by Core-phase tasks 2.x and Integration-phase tasks 3.x.
